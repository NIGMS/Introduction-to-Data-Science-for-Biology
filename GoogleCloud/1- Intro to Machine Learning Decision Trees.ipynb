    " A **Decision Tree** is a supervised machine learning model that allows us to make predictions by learning simple decision rules that are inferred using available information in the dataset. \n",
    " \n",
    "- A Decision Tree is called a **supervised**  model because we know exactly what we want to figure out. For example, for our Decision Tree, we will specify that we want to figure out the missing values of the column **cases per 100,000 people**, and our model will try to find these values by making predictions for them using the the information we do have available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In contrast, in an **unsupervised**  model, we do not know exactly what we want to predict. Instead, an unsupervised model finds hidden relationships between different types of information and can group them based on similarities. For example, Netflix surprising you with a new show you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Decision Tree** can be pictured as a tree-like flowchart, where we start with a particular criteria and based on whether this is True (Y for Yes) or False (N for No), we chose only one of the branches. This process is then repeated at every decision until we reach the bottom of the tree, where we end up with a specific prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "![General-Decision-Tree.png](images/General-Decision-Tree.png)\n",

    "We will see how a Decision Tree can help us predict the missing **cases per 100,000 people** in more detail later on in this tutorial.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing the \"Introduction to Machine Learning: Decision Trees\" module! Throughout this noteboook, you have gained a foundational understanding of Decision Trees, a fundamental machine learning technique. By working with real-world COVID-19 data from California, you have learned how to: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand Decision Trees:** \n",
    "    Recognize how Decision Trees function as supervised machine learning models, making predicitons based on learned decision rules.\n",
    "2. **Prepare Data:** Load, inspect, and preprocess data to separate it into features and labels, crucial steps for training machine learning models. \n",
    "3. **Train a Model:** \n",
    "    Create and train a Decision Tree model using the training dataset. \n",
    "4. **Visualize and Interpret:**\n",
    "    Visualize the trained Decision Tree and understand the decision-making process at each node. \n",
    "5. **Make Predictions**\n",
    "    Use the trained model to predict missing vlaues in the dataset and evaluate its performance. \n",
    "6. **Evaluate Performance:**\n",
    "    Compare the model's predictions to actual values using visualizations and quantitative metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). \n",
    "    \n",
    "This module has equipped you with the skills to apply Decision Trees to various datasets and understand their potential and limitations. Remember, Decision Trees are the foundation for more complex models like Boosted Trees and Random Forests. \n",
    "\n",
    "We hope you found this module informative and engaging. Keep experimenting with different datasets and machine learning techniques to further enhance your skills. Happy learning! "
