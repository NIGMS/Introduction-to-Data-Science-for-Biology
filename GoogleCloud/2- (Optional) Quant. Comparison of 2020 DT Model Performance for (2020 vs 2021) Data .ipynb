    "All in all we can see that the training data variables in the years 2020 and 2021 do not have the same relationship with our target variable (cases_per_100k) as showcased by the trend lines we see in our scatterplots. There are different kinds of changes that can happen in real life once our model is deployed, this is why it's important to to retrain our model from time to time. For more information about the different kinds of changes (or drifts) that could occur over time check out this useful [website](https://arize.com/model-drift/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=18216725893&utm_content=139136719885&utm_term=data%20drift&utm_term=data%20drift&utm_campaign=Monitor+ML+-+Search&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=9379871348&hsa_cam=18216725893&hsa_grp=139136719885&hsa_ad=620214790996&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-328660210229&hsa_kw=data%20drift&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=CjwKCAjw-L-ZBhB4EiwA76YzOet2ULiqRzKwwxgXsCJhh7NgueokMbk9sBee2XAX4WtP4aaEMxPrIxoCHRsQAvD_BwE).\n",

    "We will focus on just one type of drift:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Drift:** Also called Features Drift or Covariate Drift. This happens when the relationship between the input features first used during model training change. This drift is due to changes in the statistical properties, correlations, and/or data distributions of the features since training.   \n",

    "- For instance we can observe in our first set of scatterplots that unemployment rate used to have a more pronounced positive slope in 2020, but then in 2021 this slope was less pronounced. In addition recall that these differences are also seen in other variables shown on both sets of scatterplots (libertarian_vote_percentage, democrat_vote_percentage, etc). Dr. Pleuni mentioned that in Summer 2020 most people were not vaccinated as it was not as available, whereas in 2021 it was more available; we can see this stark contrast in the first scatterplot of the second set because all the points in 2020 are clustered near the 0 percent fully vaccinated percent, whereas in 2021 we see that the lowest percentage is at least above 30% of people fully vaccinated.\n",
